# cozyhome-traces
The repository for the Cozy Home N64 (Ep. #1) Traces tutorial. In here you'll find the following:

1. Everything found in the Unity project including prefabs, scenes, and scripts.

2. I've given you a directory to write your implementations, it's found in the "Your Implementation" folder.

3. The final implementation contains some goodies I never got to film. Feel free to check them out!

4. Happy coding :)
